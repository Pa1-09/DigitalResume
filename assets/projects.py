PTC refers to communication-based/processor-based train control technology that provides a system capable of reliably and functionally preventing train-to-train collisions, over speed derailments, incursions into established work zone limits, and the movement of a train through a main line switch in the improper position. PTC systems vary widely in complexity and sophistication based on the level of automation and functionality they implement, the system architecture used and the wayside system upon which they are based (e.g., non-signaled, block signal, cab signal, etc.)
I-ETMS (Interoperable Electronic Train Management System) is one of the PTC types approved by FRA.
